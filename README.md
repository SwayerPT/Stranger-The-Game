- Player Matchmacking: It is with great pleasure that we present the Player vs Player. This mode is active and will be very funny a long the time. But be careful your Strenght and Defense are everything in the Match, if you lose you can lose your Respect, Coins and get injured in the Medic Hut. 
 How it works: The matchmacking are going to find players with the same respect estruture as you. The match will determine the winner after calculating the best damaged and Health taken from both players.

- Find Animals: it’s a pvm match against moobs that will give to you more respect, strength, defense, coins and some drops depending on higher moobs. The PVM match was made to determine your strength and defense against the moob. The moob can kill you if you try to attack a bigger one. Dying can be bad for you, once it happens you will be injured in the Medic Hut for a few minutes(45 max) and you can lose some of your respect. Leaving the Medic Hut will adding +100 health per time.

- Find Animals > Drop Rates: Drops of Chests, Weapons, Armours and Food are allowed for all levels. Everytime you kill a moob you will have a chance to drop something. By reaching higher levels your Drop will increase and give to you better values (Damage or Defense).
